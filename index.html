	     <p>Hi, I’m Dontai. I was born and raised in Chicago, and I am majoring in game design. By the time this semester is over, I will be hoping for a 3.0 or higher GPA. When I graduate from IIT college, my goal is to have a 4.0 GPA and walk out of here with a job.
	</p>
        <p>I also like to work on music and listen to music in my free time. I don't usually play games too often only because I'm too busy studying.
	</p>
	    <p>Back when I had a family dog, a Chihuahua, I was a reckless little child, but I loved this dog in a twisted way because I threw him down the stairs. My thoughts that I can remember from when I did that are in the lines of an experiment. I regret it even to this day—that's how much I loved him. He's not around anymore; he ended up dying by falling off the bed.
